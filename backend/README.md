# Backend
The backend server developped using Node.js

An admin interface/dashboard should also be implemented.

# To start
Make sure the latest version of Node.js is installed (npm is included with it for managing pkgs)
1. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
2. Run `npm run dev` to start the server (the script automatically restarts the server whenever there's a .js file change)
